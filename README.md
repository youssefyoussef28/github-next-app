This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.js`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Concepts Learned from this Application

- Layout : Creating a layout.jsx file in any page-folder/app-directory can alter the layout of the page.
- Metadata : Adding and export const metadata object with a title can alter the Page title (SEO)
- GoogleFonts : Importing google fonts from next with specific weights in a variable and applying the variable as a class name to the children container in the layout.
- SSC : Cannot use useState and useEffect in server side components. There is no life cycle method in server side components they just load. Add "use client" to turn a component to a client component.
- Suspense Boundaries provide a much better user Experience as we can define a fallback prior to a component loading.
